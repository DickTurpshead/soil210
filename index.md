### What is This Website for?
I created this website for students enrolled in SOIL 210 *Food Systems and Healthy Lifestyles* class. The assignment requires finding information sources on a common food in the U.S in terms of the historical production practices, economics, consumer acceptance, etc. The list of foods include: 
- Banana
- Coffee
- Sugar 
- Chicken â€“ packaged not whole
- Avocados
- Vegetable oil or Crisco
- Milk 


### Learning Outcomes
After reviewing the contents of this guide, you will be able to:
1. Apply Boolean logic to search strategy
2. Select journals and databases for research in agriculture/food science
3. Find popular and scholarly sources on chosen topic
4. Evaluate and revise search strategy based on search results
