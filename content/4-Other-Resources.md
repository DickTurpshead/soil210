## Print Books
If you are on campus, you can use stack browsing as a viable search strategy to find print books on a topic. That is to visit the library and locate the physical bookshelves to browse the book collections with a particular subject focus area using Library of Congress Call Numbers. For example, if you are interested in food crops, you would want to look for call numbers that start with SB175-177. Other relevant call numbers include: 
<html>
   <head>
      <style>
         table {width: 100%;}
         table, td, th {
            border-collapse: collapse;
            padding: 8px;
            border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
         
         th {            
            style="text-align:Center"
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding-top: 12px;
            padding-bottom: 12px;
            background-color: #f1b300;
            color: white;
            }
      </style>

## Government Documents
When searching the library catalog, you can filter the results by `Government Documents` under `Resource Type`. These documents are located on the library basement. You can click <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/govdocs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> or email <a href = "mailto: rattebur@uidaho.edu">Rami Attebury</a> to learn more about how to access government documents. 

You can use Google to search for government documents as well. Add `site:gov` at the end of your keyword search terms will yield results from government webpages. For instance, if you are looking for regulations of the sugar changed to meet demand or changes in the industry, you can search for *sugar AND regulation\* site:gov*. Note that the quality and objectivity of the information on .gov sites can vary widely.

## Citation
Remember to cite your sources and format them according to the <a href="https://style.mla.org/works-cited/works-cited-a-quick-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLA style</a>. 

You may also consider using a citation manager (if you have never used one before) to cite your sources. A citation manager can be a time saver, and is incredibly useful if you are thinking about pursuing a masterâ€™s or doctoral degree in which considerable writing is expected. Check out the recording of library workshop on Citation Management with Zotero below if interested.
